# Internet_Service_Churn_Prediction_Model
A Machine Learning Model Trained to Predict Churning Among Customers of an Internet Service.

The model has the following accuracies with various algorithms used to train and test the model:

GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It exhaustively searches over a specified set of hyperparameters and finds the combination that gives the best performance for a given performance metric. This helps in optimizing the model's performance and making it more accurate.
