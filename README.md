# Internet_Service_Churn_Prediction_Model
A Machine Learning Model Trained to Predict Churning Among Customers of an Internet Service. This was a trial in creation of Customer Churn Models.

The model has the following accuracies with various models used to train and test the model:

|                       |RidgeClassifier  |RandomForestClassfier |GridSearchCV |     
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Training Set Accuracy |     82.52%      |        93.32%        |     N/A     |
| Testing Set Accuracy  |     82.97%      |        92.98%        |     N/A     |
| Overall Accuracy      |     82.75%      |        93.15%        |     96.88%  |

GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It exhaustively searches over a specified set of hyperparameters and finds the combination that gives the best performance for a given performance metric. This helps in optimizing the model's performance and making it more accurate.

Version 2.0: To be released soon - Including an interactive dashboard and a finely-tuned customer churn model.
